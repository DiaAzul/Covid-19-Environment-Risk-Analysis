    Infectious diseases are transmitted in many ways, including through direct contact with an infected individual or indirectly through contact with their bodily fluids, fomites (particles of infectious material), and exhaled respiritory droplets. With each new infectious disease there is a period of time whilst research is carried out until it is clear which modes of tranmission are most dominant in transmitting the diseases from an infectious to a susceptible person.
    
    In the case of Covid-19 (caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus), infection is thought to be transmitted in respiritory droplets, thought that doesn't mean that infection can be passed through other modes of transmission. There is debate whether transmission is predominantly due to spew, the large respiritory droplets which are ejected during breathing, sneezing and coughing; or whether infectious particles are also aerosolised. Spew droplets are typically greater than five to ten micrometers in size and fall close to the infectious person, whereas aerosols are much smaller and can travel great distances floating on air currents.

    The extent to which respiritory droplets are aerosolised and whether they remain infectious is important, and determines whether additional mitigations are required. A disease which is predominantly transmitted in spew and where there is minimal aerosol generated is mitigated by recommending adequate physical distance between people, the wearing of face coverings, hand washing and making sure the environment is cleaned. However, if large numbers of respiritory particles are aerosolised and they remain in the air for long periods of time, travelling significant distances and creating clouds of concentrated infectious particles, then an increased number of people are likely to become infected. It should be noted that aerosolised infectious disease are not new and the health service has significant experience minimising risks associated with them.

    The purpose of this risk assessment tool is to help identify situations where infectious disease transmission through aerosol may be a significant risk, and where mitigations may need to be considered to reduce the risk of infection. It must be noted that whilst there is strong evidence that Covid-19 is transmitted as an aerosol, whether it is a greater risk than spew or other modes of transmission will take time to establish. Even if this tool identifies that that aerosol transmission is a risk, precautions will still need to be taken to minimise the risk of transmission due to spew and fomites by encouraging social distancing and hand washing.

    Whilst every effort was taken to ensure that the information contained in this tool is accurate and informative, it does not consitute professional advice. We would encourage anyone making decisions which may affect large numbers of people to seek futher advice.

  heading: 'Indoor micro-environment'
  text: |
    The risk assessment tool assumes that the greatest risk of infectious disease transmission due to aerosol is wihtin an indoor micro-environment. The model assumes that the environment can be represented by a cubic structure, and that the air is well mixed within the environment.

    Well mixed has a number of implications relating to risk, most importantly that all susceptible people within the space have an equal risk of becoming infected and that there are no specific concentration hotspots which might increase the risk of infection. For small to medium sized environments (rooms) over a long enough period of time these assumptions should hold. However, in very large spaces (auditoriums), and where there are strong airflows (in the presence of powerful mechanical venitilation) an uneven distriubtion of the aerosol concentration within the environment is likely to have an impact on risk. Even within smaller spaces, the impact of funiture placement, ventilation and the movement of people may impact how the concentration of infectious material may accumulate.

    The risk assessment tool presents risk on a radar chart (displayed either above or to the right of this text). Risk is rated along five axes which are discussed in more detail below. Each axis shows the extent to which that factor is driving risk up (higher) or down (lower). The baseline medium risk is considered to be a small grocery store (small supermarket) with the following characteristics:
    * Infectious person: Standing, no mask
    * Environment size: Length (30m) x Width (20m) x Heaight (3m), 
    * Ventilation: Mechanical ventilation (1.1 Air Changes per Hour)
    * Physical distancing: 60 customers in the environment at any one time
    * Susceptible people: Standing, no mask
    * Average time a person is in the environment: 30 minutes

exhalation:
  heading: Exhalation
  text: |
    Respiritory droplets are emitted from an infectious person as they breath. The emission rate, is depdenent upon the amount of virus load present within the persons respiritory system, and the volume of air emitted with each breath. Viral load can vary over the infectious period. The amount used in the risk assessment assumes an asymptomatic person. An average quanta emission rate is calculated across three activities.

    The amount of exhaled virus may be reduced if the infectious person wears a face mask. A reudction in quanta emitted is selectable, including no mask (baseline), cloth mask (home made), surgical mask and N95 mask.

ventilation:
  heading: 'Ventilation'
  text: |
    Within an indoor environment, aerosolised virus particles will accumulate in the air over a period of time until removed. Virus particles may be removed either by falling to the floor due to gravity or air exchange with the outside environment. Virus particles can remain suspended in the air for hours, and it is assumed that the primary mode for removing particles from the environment is ventilation. 

    Ventilation may be natural or mechanical. Natural ventilation is the natural flow of air between the inside and outside environments resulting from openings in the buildings structure (e.g. doors, windows, ventilation slots). Building regulations aimed at improving thermal efficiency of housing reduces the amount of natural ventilation; this may increase the risk of that infectious particles build up in the environment. Mechanical ventilation uses machinery to exchange air within the buildng. This may be required in environments where there are large numbers of people, heat generating equipment, air-borne pollutants, etc.
    The concentration of virus particles will be slower in larger buildings with greater air volume, though these spaces may have larger numbers of susceptible people who could become infected.

    Ideally, all spaces should be large and well ventilated to minimise the build up of aerosolised particles.
    Note: Outdoor spaces may be considered indoor spaces when there are temperature inversions (e.g. above crowds) which trap aerosols at or near ground level, and when there is little background air movement to disperse any aerosol.

    Air exchange rates (Air Changes Per Hour - ACH) can vary significantly depending upon the age of the property, property design, maintenance and presence of mechanical ventilation. Guidline air exchange rates for the risk assessment see (https://www.vent-axia.com/sites/default/files/Ventilation%20Design%20Guidelines%202.pdf) for a more extensive list). Note that these are guidelines for effective ventilation many properties will diverge from these values and will have worse or better ventilation which will have a significant impact on infection rates.

    * Natural ventilation (no windows, doors open): 0.3 (Building regulation recommend 0.3 l/s/m^2 which is 0.3 ACH but can be higher if doors and windows open, increasing to 0.5 or more depending on external wind blowing air through)
    * Natural ventilation (windows/door, one side): 0.67
    * Natural ventilation (windows/doors two side): 1.0
    * Offices: 8 (range 6-10)
    * Restaurants: 10 (range 8-12)
    * Cafes and coffee bars: 11 (range 10-12)
    * Gymnasium: 6 (minimum)
    * Pubs: 12 (minimum)
    * Schoolrooms: 6 (range 5-7)
    * Shops and supermarkets: 11 (range 8-15)
    * Conference rooms: 10 (range 8-12)

distance:
  heading: 'Distance'
  text: |
    The risk of infectious disease transmission increases the closer a susceptible peron is to an infected person. The calculation of this risk for all situations in a specific situation as it depends on the airflow between the infected and susceptible person. For instance the susceptible person's body heat might be sufficient to generate an updraft which pushes infectious particles above their head; an infectious person talking loudly, without a mask, might generate a plume of spew which travels several meters in still air; and, someone wearing a mask might cause particles to be emitted sideways rather than straight ahead. Even within a building, the arrangement of ventilation, heating, obstacles and natural airflow may case particles to move in unpredictable directions and over significant distances.

    The model assumes that people are equally distributed over the surface area of the microenvironment, and that the air is well enough mixed that the risk of inhalation of an infectious particle is equal for all people at all times. Therefore, the number of potential people infected is related to the density of people within the microenvironment at any one time (other paramters in the risk assessment showing the impact of other factors on the risk of people being infected)

inhalation:
  heading: 'Inhalation'
  text: |
    Inhalation by susceptible people is the reverse of exhalation by infected people. The risk of infection is driven by the inhalation rate (m3 h-1) as modified by any face coverings. With the exception of clinical personal protective equipment the impact of face coverings is considered low. Note, the model excludes risk associated with infection resulting from deposition of infectious droplets on non respiritory mucosal surfaces (e.g. eye).

time:
  heading: 'Time'
  text:
    The final component of the risk assessment is time, both the amount of time that infectious and susceptible people spend in the environment. The longer the infecious person is in the environment, the greater the concentration build up of infectious material. The longer the susceptible person is in the environment the more chance they have of becoming infected. If the susceptible person arrives some time after the infectious person has left then quanta concentrations will have reduced due to the diluting effect of ventilation.

    The baseline time assumes that infectious and susceptible people are in the microenvironment at the same time and for an amount of time that would create an X% risk of the susceptible person becoming infected.
