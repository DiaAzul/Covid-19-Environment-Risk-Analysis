    *This environment risk assessment discusses the risks that Covid-19 presents within an indoor environment and provides a risk chart highlighting those areas which may present greatest risk for onward transmisson of disease from an infectious to susceptible person*

    Infectious diseases are transmitted in many ways, including through direct contact with an infected individual or indirectly through contact with their bodily fluids, fomites (particles of infectious material), and exhaled respiritory droplets. With each new infectious disease there is a period of time whilst research is carried out until it is clear which modes of tranmission are most dominant in transmitting the diseases from an infectious to a susceptible person.
    
    In the case of Covid-19 (caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus), infection is thought to be transmitted in respiritory droplets, thought that doesn't mean that infection can be passed through other modes of transmission. There is debate whether transmission is predominantly due to spew, the large respiritory droplets which are ejected during breathing, sneezing and coughing; or whether infectious particles are also aerosolised. Spew droplets are typically greater than five to ten micrometers in size and fall close to the infectious person, whereas aerosols are much smaller and can travel great distances floating on air currents.

    The extent to which respiritory droplets are aerosolised and whether they remain infectious is important, and determines whether additional mitigations are required. A disease which is predominantly transmitted in spew and where there is minimal aerosol generated is mitigated by recommending adequate physical distance between people, the wearing of face coverings, hand washing and making sure the environment is cleaned. However, if large numbers of respiritory particles are aerosolised and they remain in the air for long periods of time, travelling significant distances and creating clouds of concentrated infectious particles, then an increased number of people are likely to become infected. It should be noted that aerosolised infectious disease are not new and the health service has significant experience minimising risks associated with them.

    The purpose of this risk assessment tool is to help identify situations where infectious disease transmission through aerosol may be a significant risk, and where mitigations may need to be considered to reduce the risk of infection. It must be noted that whilst there is strong evidence that Covid-19 is transmitted as an aerosol, whether it is a greater risk than spew or other modes of transmission will take time to establish. Even if this tool identifies that that aerosol transmission is a risk, precautions will still need to be taken to minimise the risk of transmission due to spew and fomites by encouraging social distancing and hand washing.

    Whilst every effort was taken to ensure that the information contained in this tool is accurate and informative, it does not consitute professional advice. We would encourage anyone making decisions which may affect large numbers of people to seek futher advice.

    **Change the options in the blue boxes to calculate the risk for a particular micro-environment**

    The risk assessment tool assumes that the greatest risk of infectious disease transmission due to aerosol is wihtin an indoor micro-environment. The model assumes that the environment can be represented by a cubic structure, and that the air is well mixed within the environment.

    Well mixed has a number of implications relating to risk, most importantly that all susceptible people within the space have an equal risk of becoming infected and that there are no specific concentration hotspots which might increase the risk of infection. For small to medium sized environments (rooms) over a long enough period of time these assumptions should hold. However, in very large spaces (auditoriums), and where there are strong airflows (in the presence of powerful mechanical venitilation) an uneven distriubtion of the aerosol concentration within the environment is likely to have an impact on risk. Even within smaller spaces, the impact of funiture placement, ventilation and the movement of people may impact how the concentration of infectious material may accumulate.

    The risk assessment tool presents risk on a radar chart (displayed either above or to the right of this text). Risk is rated along five axes which are discussed in more detail below. Each axis shows the extent to which that factor is driving risk up (higher) or down (lower). The baseline medium risk is considered to be a small grocery store (small supermarket) with the following characteristics:
    * Infectious person: Standing, no mask
    * Environment size: Length (30m) x Width (20m) x Heaight (3m), 
    * Ventilation: Mechanical ventilation (1.1 Air Changes per Hour)
    * Physical distancing: 60 customers in the environment at any one time
    * Susceptible people: Standing, no mask
    * Average time a person is in the environment: 30 minutes

exhalation:
  heading: Exhalation
  text: |
    Respiritory droplets are emitted by an infectious person as they breath and each droplet is capable of carrying infectious material (viral load). The amount of infectious material carried in droplets varies significantly, and is depdent on a wide range of characteristics such as how long ago the person become infected, the person's age, and how hard they are breathing. Droplets also vary in size and the viral load may vary depending upon where in the respiritory system the droplets were generated. An infectuous person may not know that they are infected. In many instances they may be infectuous but have not yet started showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) or are infectuous and will never show symptoms (asymptomatic). There is evidence that people are most infectuous at the point just before they start showing symptoms.

    The risk assessment considers how hard the patient is breathing using the expiratory rate. This is lowest when a person is resting and increases as the level of exertion increases. For very strenuous activity we don't have data for the model, however, we may want to consider whether an infected person will be able to undertake work of that intensity and for long durations. High intensity environments, where high respiritory rates are sustained over longer periods should be considered high risk until evidence proves otherwise. Note this may include activities where there is a high level of vocalisation such as shouting, singing and other activities where a person speaks with a loud or intense voice.

    The most important mitigation against exhalation of respiritory droplets is to cover the mouth. At a most basic level this includes covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. As noted earlier, infectious material is exhaled in every breath and face coverings may be appropriate to reduce the number and size of infectious respiritory droplets. This is particularly important when people are in indoor environments where aerosolised droplets can accumulate over time. Face coverings may be as simple as a home-made cloth mask, surgical mask or respirator. Each provides increasing levels capability of reducing emission of particles over time, however, this reduction is reduced if coverings don't fit well and if they are not well cleaned and maintained.

    The risk assessment considers three broad types of face coverings:

    * None - The majority of people are not wearing a face covering within the environment
    * Cloth mask - Home-made or shop bought masks using general purpose materials such as cotton or polyester.
    * Surgical mask - These are designed for use within a clinical setting and include multiple layers of specialist materials to minimise the risk of infectious material transmission.
    * Respirator - The majority of people are wearing respirators that reduce emission of particels by 95% or more.

ventilation:
  heading: 'Ventilation'
  text: |
    Whilst spew falls to the ground within about 20-30 seconds, aerosols can remain suspended in the air for extended periods (potentially up to three hours or more). There is some discussion as to whether any infectuous material in these droplets is viable and can cause infection if inhaled, however, it is prudent to consider this risk and real world case studies shows that aerosol transmission is a demonstrated route of infection.

    The concentration of respiritory droplets builds up over time, and the first defence is to reduce the rate at which an infectious person emits respiritory droplets. This can be achieved by keeping the respiration rate low and recommending people wear face coverings. However, this will not stop all respiritory droplets being exhaled into the environment, and over time the concetration of infectious droplets will increase - the greater the concentration, the greater the risk that someone will become infected.

    All buildings possess a greater or lesser degree of ventilation, whether natural or mechanical. The more rapidly air can be exchanged and infectious particles removed from the micro-environment then the less chance that concentrations of infectious particles will develop. In many cases enhanced ventilation may be a significant mitigation against the spread of infectious diseases. However, recent building regulations which have focused on thermal efficiency may inadvertantly increased the risk that concentration of infectious diseases builds more quickly due to reduced exchange of air. Care should be taken to review ventilation of micro-environments to ensure that air is changed as frequently as possible to reduce the risk that respiritory droplets are allowed to accumulate in the environment.

    Each environment is different, however, the following broad values were used for the air exchange rate when developing the model:
    * Natural ventilation: 0.2 per hour with doors, windows closed increasing to 1.0 per hour with doors/windows open on two sides of the house.
    * Offices: 6 - 10 per hour
    * Restaurants, cafes, bars: 8 - 12 per hour
    * School rooms: 5 - 7 per hour
    * Conference rooms: 8 - 12 per hour
    * Shops and supermarkets: 8 - 15 per hour

    The above are based upon recommended air conditioning rates. In practice it is likely that many buildings will not achieve these rates of air exchange. It is recommended that the professional advice is sought with respect to air exchange rates. In addition to reducing the risk associated with infectuous particles, it is good practice to design environments with good air quality to provide a healthy environment for those who inhabit them.

distance:
  heading: 'Distance'
  text: |
    The risk of infectious disease transmission increases the closer a susceptible person is to an infected person. At very close range there is an increased risk that spew from the infectious person is inhaled by a susceptible person, especially if they are facing each other. For Covid-19, Public Health organisations have recommended a minimum separation distance between people (for example 2m separation for 15 minutes). Attention should be paid to the concept of time, in that the risk of infection is dependent on the time that a person is exposed to infectious material - a longer period of exposure increases the risk of infection, brief periods of exposure will have low (but not zero) risk. Respiritory droplets emitted as spew should fall to the ground where they are deposited on surfaces (including hands) which people may come into contact with. Hand washing and cleaning environments is highly recommended by Public Health organisations to reduce the spread of infectious disease.

    Those further away from an infectious person may still be at risk of intection, due to any build up of infectious aerosol particles in the air. As discussed previously, this will depend upon the respiritory rate of an infectious person, whether they are wearing face coverings and the ventilation rate within the room. However, for a small to medium size room, the infectious droplets can rapidly spread through the environment and build to levels of concentration that increases the risk of infection.

    Reducing the number of people  within an environment has two benefits: The first is to reduce the density of people within the room making it easier to maintain physical distance from other people; the second is to reduce the people that may become infected should an infectious person be present within the room.

    The risk assessment assumes people are evenly distributed through the environment and that the air is well mixed so that concentration levels are the same in all places. In reality, this may not hold true and thought should be applied to identify any characteristics of the environment that may cause people to crowd together, or for localised concentrations of infectuous particles to develop.

inhalation:
  heading: 'Inhalation'
  text: |
    The inhalation rate should match the exhalation rate for all individuals within the environment. The risk assessment assumes that this is the case. However, there are situations where inhalation and exhalation rates may vary where different groups of people are undertaking different activities - e.g. the difference between shop workders and customers. Whlst this risk assessment proints to areas of increased risk, more complex environments will require greater study.

    The risk of infection by a susceptible person may be reduced by an appropriate well fitting face covering. It should be assumed that face coverings do not provide increased protection from Covid-19 infection unless they specifically designed to do so. Such designations of protection should be specific to Covid-19 rather than a general protection from airborne pollutants or infectious particles. Further protection of the eyes may be appropriate where there is a significant risk of infection from respiritory droplets.

time:
  heading: 'Time'
  text:
    So far this risk assessment has followed the path of a respiritory droplet from an infectious person to a susceptible person, and has considered the impact of activity levels, facial coverings, ventilation rates, and physical distance on the risk of infection. The final risk factor, mentioned previously, is time - with longer durations of exposure to infection increasing the risk. Reducing the time that an infectious person is in an environment reduces the risk that infectious aerosol droplets reach significant concentration; reducing the time that susceptible people are in the environment reduces their exposure to any infectious aerosol and time spent in close proximity to an infectious person.

    Special care should be taken in environments where people spend extended periods of time, in close proximity and where ventilation is unable to reduce aerosol concentration levels. Where these conditions exists, for example in an office, encouraging people to work from other locations may be appropriate.
